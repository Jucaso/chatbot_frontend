# Books recommender chatbot
This is the frontend side of Pepe Chatbot, here is where the tool chat were defined and developed. This chatbot is based on three ways of getting recommendations:

**1. Using flow dialogs:** 
You can interact with Pepe chatbot through flow dialogs to receive a recommendation. This functionality is mainly focused on assisting individuals who are unsure about what they are looking for.

**2. Providing a chat input:**
You can ask Pepe chatbot about any topic you want to read by simply typing 'Recomiéndame' followed by your desired topic (spelling and punctuation are not relevant). In this way, you will receive the top five recommendations defined by Pepe.

**3. Recommendation based on others recommendations:**
You can ask to Pepe for recommendations based on others recommendations already done, below each recommendation you will find a "Recomiéndame más de esto" button. Clicking on this button will gather all the information from that specific book and generate another set of top five recommendations, more focused on similar recommendations to the selected book.
